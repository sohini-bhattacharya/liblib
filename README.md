<h3 align="center"><span style="color:#FFC0CB">A library built to make smartphone-sensing frameworks simple and easy.</span></h3>

<h4 align="center">
Using this kotlin library, you can access the important and widely-used sensors available in your mobile devices with just a line of code. You can save and monitor the data for sensors like Proximity, Magnetometer, Accelerometer, etc. to more complex GPS sensors, Bluetooth Low Energy sensors, WiFi sensors, Android UUID and many more. Support classes like CSV data recorder and permission requirements are already taken into consideration by this library.
Along with that, there are case specific classes and functions, ie. to record and calculate the height of your current level of elevation or to predict your state of being in an indoor or outdoor environment setting. Anyone who is interested to record and analyze sensor data for ubiquitous computing, but isn't familiar with kotlin or wants to head straight into data collection, then this library is for you!
